THE GAME: 

You are a hunter of fine crystals and jewels. 

You must collect the exact amount of crystals and match the Goal Score to win the game.

At the beginning of the game, you will be given a random number called Goal Score. You can collect 4 crystals: red, blue, green and yellow.

Begin by clicking on a crystal. Each crystal possesses a different value so you will add a unique and random amount of points to your Total Score each time you click on one. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

You win the game by matching your Total Score to the Goal Score. You lose the game if your total score goes above the Goal Score.

If you win or lose, it will be depicted on the game board.

Each time the game starts, it will change the value of the cyrstals.

If you choose to play a new game, click the Play Again button. Your win and loss counts will remain and your Goal Score will update with a new number. Your Total Score will reflect your new guesses once you start clicking.

So, you can play forever and collect as many crystals as possible!

Good luck and have fun!
